	When sleep duration and mood were monitored longitudinally in a 59-year-old
	woman with bipolar illness, sleep loss appeared to mediate the triggering
	of mania by psychosocial and pharmacological precipitating factors.
	This interpretation was supported by observations that mania could
	repeatedly be induced experimentally by depriving her of sleep for
	one night. The patient{\textquoteright}s data illustrate how sleep-loss
	might be a preventable cause of mania in a variety of situations.},
